## Below is a log of my experience with developing this project. 

### 24.10.2020:

* Learnt about structs in methods Rust.
* Created structs for the project.
* Successfully generated an bmp image using the structs with width 255 and height 90.
* Used a function from the Rust Forum implemented by [nateozem](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/how-to-serialize-a-u32-into-byte-array/986/5) to convert a u64 to a u8 array.

### 23.10.2020:

* Learnt about bmp files. Sample links: [Bitmap images in C](http://ricardolovelace.com/creating-bitmap-images-with-c-on-windows.html), [The bmp file format](http://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~elliott/ee552/studentAppNotes/2003_w/misc/bmp_file_format/bmp_file_format.htm), [BMP](http://www.onicos.com/staff/iz/formats/bmp.html).
